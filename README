This is an automation framework designed to validate the features in the site: www.saucedemo.com.
The development of this framework follows the next description:

Background:
ABC Company is developing a new e-commerce website that allows customers to purchase products online. The website has several pages, including a homepage, product pages, checkout pages, and account pages. The website is expected to have a high volume of traffic, and it needs to be fast, reliable, and secure.

Project Challenge:
Your task is to design and implement a test automation framework for the ABC Company e-commerce website. The framework should cover the following types of testing:

Unit testing: Test individual components and functions of the website.

Integration testing: Test the integration of different components of the website.

Functional testing: Test the functionality of the website, including the homepage, product pages, checkout pages, and account pages.

Performance testing: Test the performance of the website under different traffic loads and identify performance bottlenecks.

Security testing: Test the security of the website and identify vulnerabilities.

The test automation framework should be developed in Java or Python and should use a testing framework of your choice (e.g., JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, Appium, etc.). The framework should include test cases for each type of testing and should generate reports that summarize the results of the tests.

Your solution should also include a README file that explains how to run the tests and generate the reports. The README file should include any setup instructions or dependencies required to run the tests.

In addition to implementing the test automation framework, you should also provide a report that summarizes the results of the tests and identifies any issues or areas for improvement. The report should include recommendations for how to address any issues or improve the website's performance, security, and reliability.
